    text: "If you're not ready to commit to purchasing a tiny house, or if you want the flexibility to try out tiny house living before making a decision, renting a tiny house may be the right choice for you. When you rent a tiny house, you have the opportunity to try out the lifestyle and see if it's a good fit for you before making a long-term commitment. You'll also have the freedom to move to a new location or try out a different tiny house model if you desire. Our rental options are available on a short-term or long-term basis, so you can choose the option that best fits your needs.

    text: "Finding the right location for your tiny house can be a challenge, but we're here to help. Whether you want to be near the city or in a more rural area, we can help you find a spot that meets your needs and preferences. One option is to find a tiny house community or village where you can settle among like-minded individuals and enjoy a sense of community. These communities often have shared amenities such as gardens, playgrounds, and common areas, and they may also have rules and regulations to ensure that everyone is able to coexist harmoniously. If you prefer a more isolated location, we can help you find a piece of land where you can place your tiny house. We'll assist you in researching zoning laws and other regulations to ensure that your tiny house is allowed in the area, and we can also help you negotiate a lease or purchase agreement for the land.",
